# Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART)

## Overview
BART is a powerful machine learning model that combines the flexibility of decision trees with Bayesian inference. It approximates an unknown function f(x) using a sum of regression trees, where each tree acts as a weak learner.

## Key Components

### 1. Model Structure
- BART approximates f(x) = E(y|x) using a sum of m regression trees:
  ```
  y = h(x) + ε, where h(x) = Σ g_j(x)
  ```
  - Each g_j represents a regression tree
  - ε ~ N(0, σ²) represents the error term

### 2. Tree Components
- Each tree consists of:
  - Binary decision rules at interior nodes
  - Terminal nodes with associated parameters (μ)
  - Decision rules typically based on single components of x
  - Full binary tree structure (each node has 0 or 2 children)

### 3. Regularization Prior
The model uses a regularization prior to prevent overfitting, consisting of:

#### Tree Prior (T_j)
- Controls tree depth using parameters α and β
- Default values: α = 0.95, β = 2
- Uses uniform prior for splitting variables and rules

#### Terminal Node Parameters (μ_ij)
- μ_ij ~ N(0, σ_μ²)
- σ_μ = 0.5/(k√m)
- k typically between 1 and 3

#### Error Variance (σ)
- σ² ~ νλ/χ²_ν
- ν typically between 3 and 10
- λ calibrated using data-based estimates

### 4. Model Selection
- Recommended number of trees (m): 200
- Performance improves with increasing m until plateau
- Important to avoid choosing m too small

## Key Features

1. **Flexibility**
   - Can capture both main effects and interaction effects
   - Handles varying orders of interactions
   - Adapts to complex relationships in data

2. **Regularization**
   - Prevents overfitting through prior specifications
   - Keeps individual tree effects from being too influential
   - Maintains balance between flexibility and stability

3. **Output**
   - Posterior mean estimates of f(x)
   - Pointwise uncertainty intervals
   - Variable importance measures

## Applications
- Regression problems
- Complex function approximation
- Cases where interpretability is important
- Situations requiring uncertainty quantification
