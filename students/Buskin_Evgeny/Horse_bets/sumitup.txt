Horse Race Outcome Prediction Using BART

    This project implements a sophisticated machine learning approach to predict horse race outcomes using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). 
The model aims to predict finishing positions in horse races by leveraging historical performance data and various race-related features.
    The Main challenges I think was working with Data Sources and Pre-Processing, well and setting up BART on local PC.
The project utilizes two primary data sources:
Past Performance Data: 
Contains detailed pre-race information including: 
Horse characteristics (weight, odds, jockey, trainer), Track conditions (surface type, distance), Historical performance metrics
Results Data: Captures post-race outcomes including Finish positions, Speed ratings, Final odds, etc.

For Feature Engineering
The model incorporates several sophisticated features:
Basic race information: Distance (normalized), Surface type (Dirt/Turf)
Performance metrics: Average past finish position, Win rate, Distance suitability, Jockey win rate, Field strength, Surface-specific win rate

Model Implementation
    The BART model was implemented with the following specifications:
    Number of trees: 50
    Prior probability of splitting (alpha): 0.95
    Prior probability of growing (beta): 2.0
    Noise term: HalfNormal distribution with sigma=1.0
    Sampling parameters:
    2000 draws
    1000 tuning steps
    4 chains
    Target acceptance rate: 0.95
Unfortunatly my Model Performance wasn't that great and accuracy is far from desided values..
The model's performance metrics indicate areas for improvement:
    MSE: 8.2347
    RMSE: 2.8696
    MAE: 2.3571
    R² Score: 0.0474
    Accuracy: 0.1156
These metrics suggest that while the model captures some patterns in the data, there's significant room for improvement.

Challenges and Limitations
    Model Complexity: The BART model's performance suggests that the relationship between features and outcomes is more complex than initially captured.
    Data Quality: The relatively low R² score (0.0474) indicates that there might be important features not captured in the current dataset.
    Prediction Accuracy: The 11.56% accuracy rate suggests that the model needs refinement to be practically useful.
Future Improvements
    Feature Engineering:
    Add more interaction terms between features
    Incorporate temporal features (e.g., days since last race, so we can track the rest of a horse)
    Include more detailed jockey and trainer statistics, horse parents(genetic) data
    Model Optimization:
    Experiment with different BART parameters
    Consider ensemble methods combining BART with other models
    Implement more sophisticated early stopping criteria
    Data Enhancement:
    Collect more historical data
    Include additional features like track conditions
    Incorporate weather data
Conclusion
While the current model shows promise in predicting horse race outcomes, 
the performance metrics indicate that significant improvements are needed before it can be used for practical betting decisions. 
The project demonstrates the potential of BART in sports prediction, but also highlights the challenges in modeling complex, real-world events.

I believe this project would have greatly benefited from being initiated earlier in the semester. 
An earlier start would have allowed us to adopt a more structured engineering approach to XML/XSD data parsing and provided 
additional time to explore the intricacies of horse racing data—particularly in identifying which features have the most significant impact on race outcomes.
Anyway, thank you so much, Adam, for this course and for your humor and dedication throughout the semester. 
It was a pleasure learning from you, I truly appreciated your involvement and guidance during the classes.
