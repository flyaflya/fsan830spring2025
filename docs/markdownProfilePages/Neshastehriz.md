## XML to xarray Challenge

Explanation:
The xml_to_xarray.py script processes an XML file containing race results by parsing it with xml.etree.ElementTree, extracting relevant data such as race details, horse names, jockeys, and trainers, and storing this information in lists. These lists are then converted into a pandas DataFrame, which is subsequently transformed into an xarray Dataset. This Dataset includes coordinates for track and race date, and variables for each race, such as horse names, positions, and odds. The script also includes functionality to save the Dataset to a NetCDF file for further analysis, and it handles errors related to file parsing and data extraction. This setup allows for efficient data manipulation and querying using Python's data science libraries.

### Code:

```python
for race_num in ds.coords['RACE_NUMBER'].values:
        positions = ds[f'race_{race_num}_positions'].values
        horses = ds[f'race_{race_num}_horses'].values
        odds = ds[f'race_{race_num}_odds'].values
        jockeys_names = ds[f'race_{race_num}_jockeys'].values
        trainers_names  = ds[f'race_{race_num}_trainers'].values
        race_df = pd.DataFrame({'horse': horses, 'position': positions, 'odds': odds, 'jockey': jockeys_names, 'trainer': trainers_names})
        top_horses = race_df.sort_values('position').head(n)

        results[int(race_num)] = top_horses
```

### Output:

Here, I put the result of the last three races:
